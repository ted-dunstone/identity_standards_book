# Identity Standards Book

The foundation of any robust, maintainable, and interoperable identification system lies in the adoption of universally accepted standards and shared interfaces. These standards encompass a wide range of protocols and guidelines, including those for data exchange, testing procedures, quality benchmarks, and best practices for the acquisition, storage, transmission, and utilization of identity information. Furthermore, they dictate the specifications for identity credentials, the structure of biometric data, and the protocols for authentication.

This book provides an introduction to the myriad of standard methodologies, from globally recognized ISO norms to consensus-based industry protocols and standardized open frameworks. Embracing these standards facilitates the creation of interoperable components that can undergo rigorous testing and validation. This enables a stable operational environment conducive to a diverse ecosystem of vendors, system integrators, and open-source initiatives. Through this exploration, this book aims to both act as a reference for identity standards, and underscore the critical role that standards play in the seamless operation and future scalability of identification systems.
